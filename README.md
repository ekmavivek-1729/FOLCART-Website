# FOLCART-Website
This is Basically based upon Art Mall. For More Information please read about Readme file. 
This project is mainly concerned about the problem faced by the small town artists in getting attached with the market or customers in selling their unique and the tribal arts.
Also by the customers who are interested in buying the artistic stuffs. We are going to design a dynamic, responsive and useful website. 
That is an FOLCART website which contains all Arts from across the country and the main theme of this website is selling an Art of local level Artist to upper level artist across our country. Also I plan to produce Tribal people Arts in this website.

My website have payment gateway also and if you want to cancel your order go to account and cancel your order. 

I have also added the covid update in my website which is redirected to Ministry of Health department page. 


I have also hosted my website on Heroku Platform. If you want to visit my website please follow the link given below.
