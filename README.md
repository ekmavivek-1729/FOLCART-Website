# FOLCART-Website

Description:-

This is Basically based upon Art Mall. For More Information please read about Readme file.
This project is mainly concerned about the problem faced by the small town artists in getting attached with the market or customers in selling their unique and the tribal arts.
Also by the customers who are interested in buying the artistic stuffs.
We are going to design a dynamic, responsive and useful website. That is an FOLCART website which contains all Arts from across the country and the main theme of this website is selling an Art of local level Artist to upper level artist across our country.
Also I plan to produce Tribal people Arts in this website.
Because Tribal art ranges through a wide range of art forms, such as wall paintings, tribal dances, tribal music, and so on.
We Provide an explorer of their Arts Across the many country and If the peoples want to sell their Art in this Mall so we provide direct money transfer to account.
